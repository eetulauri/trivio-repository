# Trivia Game Project Memo

## Project Overview
A web-based trivia game that uses Google's Gemini Pro API to generate questions and validate answers. The project aims to create an engaging, simple-to-use trivia game with AI-generated questions.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Go with Fiber framework
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 + Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini Pro API
- **Future Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Google Cloud Platform (planned)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Current Phase)
- [x] Basic Go backend setup
- [x] Gemini API integration with official SDK
- [x] Basic API endpoints
- [x] Simple Vue.js frontend
- [x] Basic game loop implementation
- [x] Dark mode UI
- [ ] Enhanced game mechanics
  - [ ] Answer history display
  - [ ] Educational tidbits
  - [ ] Fuzzy answer matching
  - [ ] Auto-focus and keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Improved UI positioning

### Phase 2: Database Integration
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Store question history
- [ ] Track user sessions
- [ ] Basic analytics implementation

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Scoring system
- [ ] Categories/difficulty levels
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Deployment
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud infrastructure
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Production deployment

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/question` - Get random trivia question
- `POST /api/check-answer` - Validate user's answer

## Current Status
- Backend implementation complete with official Gemini SDK
- Frontend implementation complete with basic functionality
- Environment variables configured
- Basic game loop working
- Working on enhanced game mechanics and UX improvements

## Recent Updates
- Switched to official Gemini Go SDK
- Implemented environment variable management
- Added proper error handling
- Configured model parameters for better responses
- Dark mode implementation complete

## Development Notes
- Gemini API requires API key (managed via .env file)
- Frontend runs on Vite development server
- Backend runs on port 8080 by default
- CORS enabled for local development
- Model parameters tuned for trivia:
  - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
  - TopK: 40 (diverse responses)
  - TopP: 0.95 (nucleus sampling)
  - MaxOutputTokens: 100 (response length)

## Planned Improvements
- Enhanced answer validation with fuzzy matching
- Educational content after each answer
- Improved UI/UX with keyboard shortcuts
- Answer history display
- Auto-progression to next question
- Better vertical positioning of game interface

## Future Considerations
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Caching strategy for questions
- Error handling improvements
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility features
- Performance monitoring
- Cost optimization for cloud hosting

## Project Goals
1. Create an engaging trivia experience
2. Demonstrate AI integration in web applications
3. Maintain clean, maintainable code structure
4. Ensure scalability for future features
5. Provide responsive and accessible UI
6. Keep infrastructure costs minimal
7. Make learning fun with educational tidbits
